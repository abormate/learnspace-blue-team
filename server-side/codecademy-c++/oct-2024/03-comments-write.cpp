Programming is often highly collaborative. In addition, our own code can quickly become difficult to 
understand when we return to it — sometimes only a few hours later! For these reasons, it’s often useful 
to leave notes in our code for ourselves or other developers.

As we write a C++ program, we can write comments in the code that the compiler will ignore as our program runs.
